    <h1>The Adorable Jumping Spider</h1>
    <section> 
      <h1>Characteristics</h1>
      <p>Jumping spiders are among the easiest to distinguish from similar spider families because of the shape of the cephalothorax and their eye patterns. The jumping spiders, unlike the other families, have faces that are roughly rectangular surfaces perpendicular to their direction of motion.  Their eye pattern is the clearest single identifying characteristic; they have eight eyes.</p>

      <h1>Behavior</h1>
      <p>Jumping spiders are generally diurnal, active hunters. Their well-developed internal hydraulic system extends their limbs by altering the pressure of body fluid (hemolymph) within them. This enables the spiders to jump without having large muscular legs like a grasshopper. Most jumping spiders can jump several times the length of their body.</p>

    <h1>Fast Facts</h1>
    <p>Jumping spiders have some of the best vision among invertebrates and use it in courtship, hunting, and navigation. Though they normally move quietly and fairly slowly, most species are capable of very agile jumps,   notably when hunting, but sometimes in response to sudden threats.</p>
    <p>Jumping spiders use their vision in complex visual courtship displays. Males are often quite different in appearance from females, and may have plumose hairs, colored or iridescent hairs, front leg fringes, structures on other legs, and other, often bizarre, modifications. </p>
